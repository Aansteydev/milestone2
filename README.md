# Milestone project 2 - Quiz

My second milestone project is a quiz that is built with a mixture of HTML, CSS and Javascript and the questions are based around Videogame trivia with a focus on the retro side of things but with a few modern questions thrown into the mixture. The intention of this quiz is to entertain fellow gamers so that they can test their knowledge on the subject but aslo as a means to showcase my skills in web design. 

## User stories

- Q. As a user I would like to be able to interact with the quiz.
- A. This will be achieved by the use of buttons that the user clicks to answe multiple choice questions, these buttons will feature feedback such as changing colour to signify a correct or incorrect response and to give an effect of being pushed by the user.

- Q. As a user I would like to challenge my knowledge on games.
- A. There is a score for incorrect and correct answers that are tallied as the user submits their answers, I originally wanted to create a leaderboard but due to time constraints I had to leave this function behind with the hopes of implementing it at a later date for my own personal growth as a coder.
