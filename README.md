# Milestone project 2 - Quiz

My second milestone project is a quiz that is built with a mixture of HTML, CSS and Javascript and the questions are based around Videogame trivia with a focus on the retro side of things but with a few modern questions thrown into the mixture. The intention of this quiz is to entertain fellow gamers so that they can test their knowledge on the subject but aslo as a means to showcase my skills in web design. 

## Aesthetic choices 

My main aim is to make a functioning website but it also needs to be interesting for the end user so I have implemented a background which covers the site with a window that holds a container for the question which is then followed by four buttons that function as multiple choice answers. The aim is to have changing backgrounds for each question so that the background displays an image that is relevant to the question being asked. There are twenty-one questions so there will be 21 images for all of the questions and a final image for the end of the quiz. I am also aiming to add a splash screen prior to the quiz starting, this will feature a simple logo which has already been created and a button to initiate the quiz which will transition the screen to the actual quiz. 

## User stories

- Q. As a user I would like to be able to interact with the quiz.
- A. This will be achieved by the use of buttons that the user clicks to answe multiple choice questions, these buttons will feature feedback such as changing colour to signify a correct or incorrect response and to give an effect of being pushed by the user.

- Q. As a user I would like to challenge my knowledge on games.
- A. There is a score for incorrect and correct answers that are tallied as the user submits their answers, I originally wanted to create a leaderboard but due to time constraints I had to leave this function behind with the hopes of implementing it at a later date for my own personal growth as a coder.
